# metext

A lightweight code editor built with Python's Tkinter GUI toolkit, metext focuses on a simple, fast editing experience.This is my first personal project for Boot.dev.

## Why I have chosen Tkinter

It's a standard library that ships with Python. Reduces the dependencies. Additionally, I want to learn it and use for other Python projects.

## Features (MVP) 
- Open/Create files
- Edit and save (UTF-8)
- Basic navigation
- Status bar (filename, line:col)

## Roadmap
- Syntax highlighting
- Light/Dark themes using `ttk.style`
- Shortcut keys (save, find, go-to-line)
- Auto-indent and line numbers
- Recent files, autosave, restore session
- Config file

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.11+
- Tkinter (`tk`/`ttk`)

## Installation
```bash
pip install metext # future
