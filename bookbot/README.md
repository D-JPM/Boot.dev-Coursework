# First Boot.dev Project:

## Aim: to build a **bookbot** Python program that analyzes novels and prints a statisitical report of the word and character usage found within.

---

## Learning Goals:
- Configuire a professional Python development environment on your local computer.
- Practice building a full project from scratch.
- Deploy it to personal GitHub account.
- Practice using a professional code editor. Iâ€™ve used VS Code before, but chose Neovim for this project to build my confidence working directly in the terminal

## How to Run:
- clone it (dont execute order 66 though)
- python3 bookbot.py

## Future work for program:
- [ ] I would like to display the report in a table (unsure on how to do this yet)
- [ ] Add percentage columns in the table for characters.
- [ ] Filter the Report alphabetically.
- [ ] Word frequency (display which words are used the most)
- [ ] Maybe some visual bar indicators
- [ ] Be able to export the report to a txt or csv file
